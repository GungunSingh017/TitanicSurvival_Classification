Titanic Survival Classiffication

The project aims at providing Classiffication model to classify the survival rate of people during the Titanic tragedy.The sinking of the RMS Titanic is 
one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 
out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

In this project, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine 
learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

Also, you will learn to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. Start with a simple 
algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project 
will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the program.
